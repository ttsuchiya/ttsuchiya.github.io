# CsSpectral for iPad

Audio Effect designs | Objective C, Core Audio, and Csound. An 8-month project at [Boulanger Labs](http://boulangerlabs.com/). (2012-13)

As the lead audio-effect designer, I authored the every effect modules (about 20 of them) except for the Phase Vocoder (Spectral #1) and Spectral EQ (Spectral #4). I was also responsible of other internals such as the scrub-able sample playback UI and the preset system. The page 2 off-line effect modules are done by other developers except that the Convolver and the Crusher are by myself.</p>
