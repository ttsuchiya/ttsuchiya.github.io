# CsSpectral for iPad

<p>Audio Effect designs | Objective C development. An internship work at <a href="http://boulangerlabs.com/" target="_blank">Boulanger Labs</a>. (2012-13)</p>
<p>As the lead &#8220;sound designer,&#8221; I authored the every audio effect (about 20 of them) except for the Phase Vocoder (Spectral #1) and Spectral EQ (Spectral #4). Also the page 2 off-line effects are done by other developers except that the Convolver and the Crusher are by me.</p>
