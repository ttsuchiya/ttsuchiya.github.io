# Wiggle / Hypnos VST Instruments

These are collaborative projects with my peers at Georia Tech: Deepak Gopinath and Shaoduo Xie. They feature a dynamic wavetable synthesis with modulatable 2-D "handles." I mainly worked on the manipulation of waveforms in sync with the phasor, and, for Wiggle, the 2-D modulator in the center of GUI akin to Korg's Vector synthesis. The projects used JUCE / C++.
