# About
I am a musician, programmer, and researcher specialized in auditory interface designs. 

I grew up in Japan surrounded by a dozen of [PC-98s](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PC-9800_series), exotic [a](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flying_squirrel)[n](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Masked_palm_civet)[i](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skunk)[m](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hedgehog)[a](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cockatiel)[l](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_raccoon_dog)[s](), and all sorts of musical instruments. I had an elite music ed, starting with the violin at the age of three. Distracted by the computers and animals, however, I refused to practice the instrument, and would rather want to be a veterinarian or a music producer. I ended up pursuing composition at [Berklee College of Music](https://www.berklee.edu/), but there were still a lot of grinding work and practicing involved, so I became a programmer instead (to automate things). Working on my PhD degree in computer music at [Georgia Tech](https://gtcmt.gatech.edu/), I learned automating things was pretty difficult when there are a lot of local problem solving with creative ideas involved -- typical when composing music or designing tools. My present focus therefore involves the design of environment that supports both data-driven automation and creative controls for solving creative design problems.

My other areas of interest are DSP, coding and compression, classic AI (not the currently popular neural nets but knowledge-based systems), and computer- / data-science education. I live and breathe JavaScript, C++, Clojure(Script), Csound, Max/MSP, and Ableton Live.

I was mentored by [Richard Boulanger](http://boulangerlabs.com/) and [Jason Freeman](http://distributedmusic.gatech.edu/jason/) in computer music. Dr. Boulanger guided me into the world of creative technologies with his unlimited wave of chaotic aesthetics, and Dr. Freeman taught me to shape my (less) chaotic inspirations into structures. Bill Finzer and Shelly Hsi, among many others at [Concord Consortium](https://concord.org/), taught me the industrial practices in science / data-science education. I've also learned Bajiquan, a Chinese martial art, for 7 years under master [Testuya Hattori](http://www.kaimonkensha.com/), managing to be somewhat lean without doing any exercise.
