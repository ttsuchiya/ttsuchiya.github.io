<p>This is a piece focused on the use of noise and &#8216;classic vocoder&#8217; &#8211; a series of BPFs processing a noise as modulator (amplitude control), and also another noise OSC as carrier. By carefully manipulating the amplitude, frequency range and scattering of each filter band of the vocoder, as well as tuning the noise colors, one can express a vast sound-scape and stories. There are 4 different sections &#8211; each loosely representing, although not quite literal, the birth and evolution of a star:</p>
<p>1 &#8211; a new star (-0:42)<br />
2 &#8211; cloud, thunder &amp; rain (-1:43)<br />
3 &#8211; underwater &amp; life forms (-2:30)<br />
4 &#8211; evolution, chaos &amp; harmony (-3:42)</p>
<p>By traveling between a fixed and animated tones, one may discover a harmonic quality in noise, and vice versa. The track uses Zebra synth for noise generation and filtering, and Ableton’s Vocoder device with noise OSC, which allows the intensity control and down-sampling.</p>

<p>This is a sound collage piece with the familiar sound of penny coin &#8211; hitting, bouncing, and resonating with various object. They are carefully composed and manipulated to create extensive soundscape. One could picture scenes with rain, pool of water, thunder, etc. The sound materials were recorded using Boss MicroBR (portable recorder.) The piece is composed using Ableton Live and various DSP techniques, such as granullarization (delay line &amp; time stretching), comb filtering, ring modulation and distortion.</p>

<p>A short mixed-world music using minimalistic element, namely Steve Reich’s “gradual phasing” technique. The first half is composed around two cowbells next to each other (in maj 2nd,) with a slightly different pace. Then, the gamelan adds a somewhat ethnic taste with a peculiar modality, as well as another layer of phase-shifting. In the second half, the original phasing motif is evolved into a more complex form, creating a wider and deeper space. The harmony and texture continue to develop toward the end, where everything stops in a synchronicity. This piece is an example that traditional ethnic instruments can produce a unique and convincing musicality when played in the minimalistic style &#8211; The echoing two notes / two cowbells creates a unique ambience with depth and space.</p>

<p>This is a &#8220;sound object&#8221; piece based on an <a href="https://www.google.com/search?um=1&amp;hl=en&amp;safe=off&amp;tbo=d&amp;authuser=0&amp;biw=1148&amp;bih=626&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=1&amp;q=Gachala+Emerald&amp;oq=Gachala+Emerald&amp;gs_l=img.3..0j0i24.19004.19004.0.19208.1.1.0.0.0.0.148.148.0j1.1.0...0.0...1c.2.dgy6M2qo0sU" target="_blank">emerald gem</a>. The object, or the sound, is presented in a dark room with a spotlight, where the perspective and light create a dynamic change of the color tone and reflection. The piece is realized using Ableton Live and 2 instances of u-he Zebra synth, for the main sound and the “resonance” element.</p>

<p>This Electronic Poem: &#8220;Traveling Through the Electric Wire” (working title) is a Varese-inspired collage piece. It is realized using a few random acoustic samples, and manipulating and arranging them in &#8220;primitive&#8221; but delicate ways. The piece invites the listener to the imaginary world inside electric lines.</p>

<p>This is a short piece for solo EWI (Electric Wind Instrument,) composed with a respect to Edgard Varese’s work “Density 21.5.” The main idea of the piece is the “diffusion” of pitch, which starts from a single tone and expands to higher and lower directions. The diffusion gets dynamic through the second section and toward the climax, where the EWI’s very wide register capability is featured. Then, the last section goes back to the original key and motifs, only that it represents a “convergence” this time. The direction of the melody framework is the opposite from the first section, but the actual pitch set turns out to be the same. This piece provides an image of continuous and circular nature of life, physics and music, using a unique digital instrument in an organic way.</p>

<p>This is a piece for 2 part impulse noises (or “crackles.”) The lower voice provides a somewhat consistent rhythmic foundation, while the higher voice is more random and moves dynamically. The lower is also modulating the cutoff frequency of the LPF on the higher noise. The piece roughly has 2 sections &#8211; the first part focusing on the rising intensity of lower crackles with a high glittering texture, and the second part is about the pitchy particles morphing into a “wind-storm” with more sustaining noise color. The track is done in Ableton with a single instance of Zebra synth &#8211; the lower part is a white noise with “down-sampling” filter, and the higher part is an impulse noise with cross-modulating LPF.</p>

<p>This piece uses only one sample, which is manipulated with phase vocoder and granular synthesis to create a variety of textures. The tools used are &#8211; SoundHack, Spear, Csound, Cecilia, and Samplitude.</p>
